ML-Model-and-Statistical-Analysis-for-used-SUV-pries-for-Australian-SUV brands: Toyota and Mitsubishi (R markdown)

The goal of the project is to find which explanatory variables impact the price of used SUVs and  build a single and multiple  linear regression model to accurately predict the price of a used SUV. Our dataset consists of data on car prices for cars sold in Australia in the year 2023.

The following statistical methods are used, and their results are analyzed and interpreted to arrive at conclusions, discuss limitations and suggest next steps

	Coefficient of Correlation and Correlation Hypothesis Test
 	Model 1: Simple Linear Regression
	Residual Analysis for underlying Assumptions
	Model 2: Simple Linear Regression after Transformation
	Model 3: Multiple Linear Regression
	Model 4: ANOVA
	Model 5: ANCOVA
